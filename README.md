   - Identified reusable UI patterns (navbar, cards, hero, forms, footer).  

2. **Design & Development**  
   - Created project structure: `index.html`, `about.html`, `contact.html`.  
   - Integrated Bootstrap 5 components, combined them for a fresh design.  
   - Added minimal custom CSS for spacing, shadows, and responsiveness.  

3. **Testing**  
   - Tested pages across desktop, tablet, and mobile views.  
   - Ensured navigation links work properly.

## 📖 Reflection

- **Time Taken:** ~6–7 hours (spread across 2 days).  
- **External Help Used:**  
  - Bootstrap documentation & examples.  
  - ChatGPT for structuring boilerplate code & CSS cleanup.  
  - Placeholder images from [Picsum Photos](https://picsum.photos).  

- **Challenges Faced:**  
  - Ensuring all components blended visually (not just copy-pasted).  
  - Making the hero + cards section look consistent across screen sizes.  
  - Setting up a working form without backend (solved using Formspree).  

- **What I Learned:**  
  - How to remix Bootstrap components into original layouts.  
  - Improved understanding of responsive design & utility classes.  
  - Importance of documenting and reflecting on the process honestly.
