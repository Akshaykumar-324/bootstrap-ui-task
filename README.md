# Bootstrap 5 Internship UI — Vocal Reminder (Demo)

This is a small demo project built to satisfy the internship task: remix Bootstrap 5 components into a clean, responsive UI.

## What you get
- `index.html` — Home page (navbar, hero, features, footer)
- `about.html` — About / Services page
- `contact.html` — Contact page with a working form (uses Formspree demo)
- `css/style.css` — Minimal custom CSS
- This repo is intentionally small and easy to host on GitHub Pages or Netlify.

## How I built it (step-by-step)
1. Created the page structure: `index.html`, `about.html`, `contact.html`.
2. Added Bootstrap 5 via CDN for fast prototyping.
3. Picked patterns from Bootstrap examples: navbar, cards, hero layout.
4. Wrote small custom CSS in `css/style.css` to keep a consistent look.
5. Tested responsiveness on desktop/tablet/mobile.

## Tools & references
- Bootstrap 5 documentation and examples (https://getbootstrap.com)
